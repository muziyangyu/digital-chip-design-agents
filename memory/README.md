# Agent Memory System

This directory holds persistent, file-based memory for the digital chip design orchestrators.
Agents read it at session start, write a run-state file before the first stage, and upsert
an experience record after each stage completes — no new infrastructure required.

## Two-Tier Design

### Tier 1 — `experiences.jsonl`
JSONL file with per-stage upsert/overwrite by run_id. One record per orchestrator run,
updated as stages complete. Machine-parseable; grows over time; never edited manually.

### Tier 2 — `knowledge.md`
Human- and agent-readable distilled summary. Seeded with known failure patterns, successful
tool flags, and PDK/tool quirks. Intended to be periodically updated by a memory-keeper skill
(see `FUTURE_WORK.md`) as experience records accumulate.

## Experience Record Schema

### Infrastructure memory (opt-in, environment-keyed)

The `infrastructure` domain is **opt-in**: the infrastructure-orchestrator writes an
`experiences.jsonl` record only when `design_state.pipeline_config.track_infrastructure` is
`true` (or it is invoked with `--track-memory`). Default is off — infrastructure state is
environment-specific and lockfiles remain the primary version source of truth, so memory is
written only when tool-version mismatches have caused repeated cross-session debugging.

When enabled, each record carries an `environment` fingerprint (`host`, `os`, `os_version`,
`arch`) and a `key_metrics.tool_versions` map. Records are **environment-keyed**: prefer entries
whose `environment.host`/`os` matches the current machine, since versions and quirks do not
transfer across hosts.

## Design State

`design_state.json` is a cross-orchestrator shared file written to the working directory.
It persists spec, interfaces, constraints, and per-domain outputs across all 15 orchestrator
boundaries. Every orchestrator reads it at session start (after `knowledge.md`) and performs
an atomic read-modify-write at session end (alongside `experiences.jsonl`).

Key top-level fields:
- `spec` — raw and structured product specification (written by architecture)
- `interfaces` — AXI/protocol interface list (written by architecture)
- `constraints` — shared timing, area, and power targets (written by architecture)
- `architecture`, `rtl`, `synthesis`, `sta`, `pd`, ... — per-domain signoff state
- `history[]` — append-only execution trace; one entry per **stage** (not per run — as of format_version 1.3), each with: `timestamp`, `agent`, `stage`, `decision` (`proceed|escalate|abandoned|await_approval`), `confidence` (`high|medium|low`), `failure_class` (see taxonomy below), `suggested_next_step` (`proceed|loop_back_to:<stage>|retry_stage|escalate|abandon`), `reason`, `constraint_ref`
- `fix_requests[]` — structured RTL fix requests written by verification/formal on DUT bug; consumed by RTL orchestrator and dispatched by pipeline-orchestrator (format_version 1.2+)
- `cross_domain_iteration_count` — integer count of verification↔RTL feedback cycles driven by pipeline-orchestrator; capped at 3 before escalation
- `pipeline_config.checkpoints` — list of stage names requiring human approval before the orchestrator may declare signoff (format_version 1.3+). Empty/absent ⇒ fully autonomous. Example: `["arch_signoff", "rtl_signoff", "signoff"]`. Written by user; never overwritten by orchestrators.
- `approved_checkpoints[]` — checkpoints cleared by the user. Each entry: `{ "stage": "<name>", "approved_at": "<ISO-8601>", "approved_by": "user" }` (format_version 1.3+).
- `pending_approval` — non-null when a human decision is required. Field `type` distinguishes: `"checkpoint"` (proactive gate set by a domain orchestrator at its sign-off boundary) vs `"escalation"` (failure-driven, set by pipeline-orchestrator). Additional fields: `stage` (checkpoint stage name or null), `agent` (orchestrator that set it), `reason`, `fix_request_id`, `last_summary`, `requires_user`.

`failure_class` values in `history[]` entries: `none` (PASS), `functional`, `timing`, `power_area`, `drc_lvs`, `coverage_gap`, `connectivity`, `tool_error`, `spec_gap`, `resource_limit`. Distinct from `fix_request.failure_class` which is scoped to verification/formal root causes.

`format_version` tiers:
- `"1.1"` — `fix_requests[]` and `cross_domain_iteration_count` present
- `"1.2"` — history entries carry standardized `confidence`/`failure_class`/`suggested_next_step`
- `"1.3"` — `pipeline_config.checkpoints`, `approved_checkpoints[]`, `pending_approval.type/stage/agent`; per-stage history entries (one per stage, not one per run)

When `fix_requests[]` contains entries with `status=open`, the chip-design-meta `pipeline-orchestrator` is responsible for routing them to the RTL orchestrator for fixing, then re-running verification.

Atomic write protocol with multi-writer protection: acquire an exclusive lock (e.g., flock or application-level mutex) around the entire read-modify-write sequence → read `design_state.json` (or {}) and record a version/checksum → modify → write to a unique temp file (e.g., `design_state.<pid>.<uuid>.tmp`) → re-check that the version/checksum of `design_state.json` is unchanged (or retry on mismatch) → rename temp to `design_state.json` while still holding the lock → release the lock. This prevents both partial writes and lost updates from concurrent orchestrators. Apply the same pattern to `experiences.jsonl` upsert operations if multiple writers can touch it.

## How Orchestrators Use This

**Session start**: Read `memory/<domain>/knowledge.md` and `memory/<domain>/run_state.md`
before the first stage. `knowledge.md` provides known failure patterns and tool flags.
`run_state.md` (if present) identifies an interrupted run to resume.

**Before first stage**: Write `memory/<domain>/run_state.md` with `run_id`, `design_name`,
`tool`, `start_time`, and `last_stage`. Update `last_stage` after each stage completes.

**Per stage**: Upsert (create-or-replace by `run_id`) one JSON line in
`memory/<domain>/experiences.jsonl` with `signoff_achieved: false` and the metrics
available so far. On final sign-off, set `signoff_achieved: true`. Do not append a second
line for the same `run_id` — overwrite the existing line.

**Optional — claude-mem index**: If `mcp__plugin_ecc_memory__add_observations` is available
in the session, also emit each applied fix as an observation to entity
`chip-design-<domain>-fixes`. Skip silently if the tool is absent — JSONL is the canonical
record; claude-mem is a supplemental cross-session search index only.
